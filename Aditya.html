        After being in the same sections ‘C’ in class 1 & 2, I was blessed by god and promoted to 3 ‘B’. I am saying so because in that class I met a new loyal friend “Aditya”. Actually I met him through Aayushmaan who may be his friend. I call him “Adi”.

        He was a person about whom the more I tell is the less. I had never seen such an intelligent and smart student ever before. He is a trustworthy, honest and loyal friend. He is also a very different because the way he can think is absolutely out of my
        mind. If you are thinking that why I am saying so. As I have already told ‘He was a person about whom the more I tell is the less’. He is my best friend and always try to become a boy like him.
