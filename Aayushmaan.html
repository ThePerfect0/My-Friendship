        The day when I firstly entered my class which was 1-C, I was very nervous. I don’t know any rules of class. I was afraid that can I able to make friends or not. But, there happened something very unexpected. The time when I sit on my bench I saw a boy
        started talking with me.
        <div class="img">
            <img src="Aayushmaan.jpg">

        He was Aayushmaan. We sat together may be on the last bench. Then I wondered that we have many things in common (such as- favorite colour, comedian etc.) I made many more friends in that class but Aayushmaan’s friendship last with me till now. There was
        one friend who may be has left the school because I had not seen him after class 1. I always remember that we 3 sit on the last bench of the middle row and they were my best friends till came my friend <b>Aditya.</b>
