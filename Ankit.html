        In sixth grade, I befriended a new acquaintance named Ankit through Aditya, who was already acquainted with him in class fifth.

        From the very beginning, I recognized he is genius. Despite not scoring well on exams, he possessed more knowledge than the entire class. He was chosen as the class's first monitor, alongside Aditya and two other girls. I must say that despite his absence
        from my class, I still get the opportunity to see him quite often during lunch or dismissal. We engage in enjoyable conversations and have developed strong bonds as good friends. It's always a pleasure to catch up with him whenever we bump (meet
        by chance) into each other.
